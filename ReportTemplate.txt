File Structure

The whole system is located inside a folder called WP_Assingment_1.
I separated the website into four different folders called ,"classes", "includes", "functions" and "core".
And the interactive pages were saved outside the folders.

Classes: inside classes is the security, database, session and validation files.
Each file works with one another to ensure the user is safe while logged in.

Includes: Inside includes is an error re-directory. This class was used at the beginning of development 
but I chose not to use it as the website is only small, and validation can stop most the errors. This file can
be used when creating a more advanced website. 

Functions: Inside functions is a sanitize file. This translates HTML strings into the chosen entities (UTF-8). 
This makes the website more secure. 

Core: Inside core is the overall connection to the database which also includes the session and connects to the "Classes" folder.
This structure is more efficient because changes can be made to the classes folder or the connection folder without having to retype
or include other folders. 

Customer Tables

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `users` (
`id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `username` varchar(20) NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(64) NOT NULL,
  `salt` varchar(32) NOT NULL,
  `name` varchar(55) NOT NULL,
  `joined` date NOT NULL,
  `email` varchar(60) NOT NULL,
  `address` varchar(55) NOT NULL,
  `address2` varchar(55) NOT NULL,
  `postcode` varchar(12) NOT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTO_INCREMENT=19 ;

I used one table with standard e-commerce details. Only one table was needed because data could be inserted by updating the table.
Salt is inserted into the database to hash the password, making it more difficult for malicious attackers to hack users.
